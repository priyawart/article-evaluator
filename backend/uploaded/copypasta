Hi, I'm Rhythm Jamwal. I'm a CSE undergrad at SMVDU in J&K, India. I started off with web development, now interested in blockchain technology. 
I like open source, and majorly work in python. 

One misconception I had about difference between bitcoins and shitcoins were that they both were equally secure as they both are based on blockchain, but as it turns out that shitcoins are not decentralized and most have a central authority that can make decisions about the network, not just that they are also insecure due to the smaller size of the network as compared to bitcoin. 

Looking forward to learn a lot from this!
